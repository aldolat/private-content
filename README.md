## Description

This plugin provides a shortcode to display a small portion of a post content only to users of a specific role. For example, you can show the hidden text to Editors or to Authors or to any other WordPress role, even a custom role.

Private Content is not intended to be used as a memberhip plugin management, but instead it should be used to show small parts of a post only to certain users or roles.

For a comprehensive explanation, please see [the official Wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/aldolat/private-content/wiki).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a way to display an alternate text to readers that haven't the rights to read the hidden text?

This plugin is not intended to be used in such way, but only in order to display a portion of a post to certain readers. Also, the hidden text must remain hidden, without the presence of an alternate text that could reveal the presence of the hidden text. Anyway, as of version 2.2, the plugin can display an alternate text, if it's necessary: you can use the `alt` option to do that. You can find more information in the [Wiki page](https://github.com/aldolat/private-content/wiki#alt-alternate-text-for-excluded-users).

Also, this plugin was created only to show a small piece of text (i.e. a couple of lines) as a note to the post for particular readers.

If you need to show the entire post only to certain readers (i.e. readers who pay to read a post), you can use a plugin like [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/).

### The hidden text is similar to the public text. Is it possible to stylize it in a different look?

Yes, you have to edit the CSS file of your current theme.
The shortcode generates a `<p>` HTML tag with some classes, for example:

* `private` to stylize all private contents
* `[role]-content` to stylize the content for that specific [role].
* `[role]-only` to stylize the content for that specific [role] only.

See the [official Wiki](https://github.com/aldolat/private-content/wiki#giving-a-style-to-the-text-generated-by-private-content) for more information.

### Does this plugin work with custom roles?

Yes, custom roles are fully supported starting from version 6.0. You can find more informationin in the [Wiki page](https://github.com/aldolat/private-content/wiki#custom_role-display-a-text-portion-to-a-custom-role-or-multiple-roles).
